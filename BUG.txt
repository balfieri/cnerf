stub out cuda_runtime.h and cuda.h
we want to keep tiny-cuda-nn - it has few kernel launches, it seems - we can turn those into macros that do real kernel launch or CPU launch
need a LAUNCH_KERNEL macro.

blocks and threads are dim3

dim3
#ifdef __NVCC__
#define LAUNCH_KERNEL3(kernel, gridDim3, blockDim3, shmem_size, stream, args) kernel<<<gridDim3, blockDim3, shared_mem, stream>>>args
#endif

#define LAUNCH_KERNEL1(kernel, gridDim1, blockDim1, shmem_size, stream, args) LAUNCH_KERNEL3(kernel, dim3(gridDim1,1,1), dim3(blockDim3,1,1), shared_mem, stream, args)
