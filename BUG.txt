cutlass/cutlass.h is stubbed out for now - means we can't train

asking Thomas where we can find render() that run.py calls.

run line du jour:

./cnerf ../nerfdata/nerf_synthetic/lego/base.ingp

Testbed::frame()
    - thinks it has to train
    - not rendering because m_task_queue is empty
    - question out to Thomas
