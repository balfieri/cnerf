Need to sanity-check image with Thomas.
Will likely need to build CUDA and add printfs to it.

run lines du jour:

./cnerf -scene ../nerfdata/nerf_synthetic/lego/base -w 128 -h 64        - takes 4.5m to run with -O3
./cnerf -scene ../nerfdata/nerf_synthetic/lego/base -w 32  -h 16        - takes 22s
./cnerf -scene ../nerfdata/nerf_synthetic/lego/base -w 8   -h 4

----------------------------------------------

this is the typical callback when it's chugging away a long time:

mma_sync
threadblock_input_layer_forward_dynamic
kernel_mlp_fused
mlp_fused_forward
inference_mixed_precision_impl
inference_mixed_precision
NerfTracer::inference_mixed_precision_impl
NerfTracer::inference_mixed_precision
trace
render_nerf
render_frame_main
render_frame
main

----------------------------------------------

note: cutlass/cutlass.h is stubbed out for now - means we can't train
