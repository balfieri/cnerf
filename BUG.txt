cutlass/cutlass.h is stubbed out for now - means we can't train

asking Thomas where we can find render() that run.py calls.

run line du jour:

./cnerf -scene ../nerfdata/nerf_synthetic/lego/base -w 128 -h 64

cudaMemcpy2DFromArray() needs to be implemented.

going very slowly

-w 32 -h 16 with -O3 is pretty fast

this is the typical callback when it's chugging away a long time
