This is a temporary repo that is being used to attempt to build
instant-ngp/src/main.cu to run on a single CPU.

I am using my own GNU-style Makefile for now, one that is familiar to me.

We can worry later about trying to put this back into instant-ngp.

These parallel repos must exist:

../instant-ngp
../tiny-cuda-nn
../tinylogger
../eigen 
../imgui
